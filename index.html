  <b>Important Concepts</b><p>

<b>How the Web Works</b><p>

The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person<br> goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a<em> HTTP Request</em> to<br> a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the<br> user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's<br> screen.<a href="www.This Video.com">This video</a> does a good job of explaining.<p>

<b>HTML</b><p></p>
HTML stands for<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> . HTML documents form the majority<br> of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes<br> "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".<a href="www.this video.com">This video</a>  gives a good<br> overview.<p></p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b><p></p>
HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell<br> browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.<a href="www.this video.com">This video</a>  explains the<br> distinction well. <p></p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b><p></p>
Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them<br> very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a<br> program.<p></p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b><p></p>
HTML elements are either <b>inline </b>or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box"<br> around the content inside of them.
